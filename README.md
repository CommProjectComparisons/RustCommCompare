Repository holds three synchronous Tcp-based message-passing communication crates with different design strategies
- variable message sizes and buffered transfers
- vaiable message sizes without buffering
- fixed sized messages with buffering

Status: nearly complete.  Minor problems with one test case. Will publish performance stats soon.
